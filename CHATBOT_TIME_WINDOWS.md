## üí¨ Example Questions to Ask

### **General Scheduling:**
```
‚ùì "When is the best time to patch the system?"

ü§ñ Response:
"Based on ML predictions, the best time windows are:

1. Saturday, 02:00 - 04:00
   ‚Ä¢ Network Load: 14.0 kW
   ‚Ä¢ Score: 95/100
   ‚Ä¢ Excellent window - Weekend night, minimal load

2. Sunday, 01:00 - 03:00
   ‚Ä¢ Network Load: 14.3 kW
   ‚Ä¢ Score: 93/100
   ‚Ä¢ Great alternative - Sunday early morning

3. Saturday, 23:00 - 01:00
   ‚Ä¢ Network Load: 16.8 kW
   ‚Ä¢ Score: 90/100
   ‚Ä¢ Good option - Late Saturday night

All three are weekend off-peak hours with predicted load under 20 kW."
```

### **Specific Patch:**
```
‚ùì "When should I schedule the Database Security Update?"

ü§ñ Response:
"For the Database Security Update (Priority 5/5, 2 hours):

ML Classification: Manual (82.7% confidence)

Recommended Windows:
1. Saturday, 02:00 - 04:00
   ‚Ä¢ Load: 14.0 kW, Score: 100/100
   ‚Ä¢ Perfect: Weekend + night + lowest predicted load
   ‚Ä¢ Crew: Alex Chen, Sarah Miller (both available)

2. Saturday, 05:00 - 07:00
   ‚Ä¢ Load: 17.1 kW, Score: 97/100
   ‚Ä¢ Excellent: Still weekend early morning
   ‚Ä¢ Lower crew competition

3. Friday, 23:00 - 01:00
   ‚Ä¢ Load: 18.5 kW, Score: 88/100
   ‚Ä¢ Good: Late night, entering weekend

The ML model classifies this as a Manual patch requiring careful crew coordination, so I recommend using Window 1 with your most skilled crew."
```

### **Multiple Patches:**
```
‚ùì "What's the optimal schedule for all my patches this week?"

ü§ñ Response:
"Here's the ML-optimized schedule for all 5 patches:

üîß Database Security Update (Priority 5)
   ‚Ä¢ Saturday, 02:00 - 04:00 (Score: 100)
   ‚Ä¢ Load: 14.0 kW [Manual]

üîß Core Network Firmware (Priority 5)
   ‚Ä¢ Saturday, 05:00 - 08:00 (Score: 97)
   ‚Ä¢ Load: 17.1 kW [Manual]

üîß Application Server Update (Priority 4)
   ‚Ä¢ Sunday, 02:00 - 03:30 (Score: 95)
   ‚Ä¢ Load: 14.3 kW [Manual]

üîß Web Server Patch (Priority 3)
   ‚Ä¢ Sunday, 22:00 - 23:00 (Score: 90)
   ‚Ä¢ Load: 16.5 kW [Manual]

üîß Backup System Patch (Priority 2)
   ‚Ä¢ Monday, 03:00 - 05:00 (Score: 85)
   ‚Ä¢ Load: 22.1 kW [Automated]

All patches scheduled during off-peak hours with average score of 93/100."
```

### **Alternative Times:**
```
‚ùì "What if Saturday morning doesn't work? Give me alternatives."

ü§ñ Response:
"Alternative windows with similar quality:

Weekend Options:
‚Ä¢ Sunday, 01:00 - 04:00 (Load: 14.3 kW, Score: 93/100)
‚Ä¢ Saturday, 23:00 - 02:00 (Load: 16.8 kW, Score: 90/100)

Weeknight Options:
‚Ä¢ Tuesday, 02:00 - 04:00 (Load: 19.2 kW, Score: 85/100)
‚Ä¢ Wednesday, 01:00 - 03:00 (Load: 20.1 kW, Score: 82/100)

I recommend the Sunday option as it maintains weekend benefits with similar low load (14.3 kW vs 14.0 kW)."
```

### **Emergency Patches:**
```
‚ùì "I have an emergency security patch. When can I do it?"

ü§ñ Response:
"For emergency patches, ML recommends immediate scheduling regardless of network load.

Current Best Options (Next 6 Hours):
1. Now (if during off-peak)
2. In 2 hours (transitioning to lower load)
3. Wait until tonight 22:00 for optimal conditions

Emergency Classification: Immediate action required
Current Load: 35 kW (moderate)
Tonight's Predicted Load: 18 kW (low)

Recommendation: If truly critical, schedule immediately. If you can wait 5 hours until tonight, you'll get 50% lower network impact."
```

‚úÖ "Give me 3 alternative windows for high-priority patches"

‚ùå "Tell me about patches"  
‚ùå "What do you think?"  
‚ùå "Help"

### **Request Multiple Options:**
"Give me the top 3 time windows for [patch name]"

### **Ask for Reasoning:**
"Why is Saturday better than Sunday?"

### **Compare Options:**
"Should I do this patch now or wait until tonight?"
