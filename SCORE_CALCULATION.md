# 📊 How Scores Are Calculated

## Overview

The Electro-call scheduler uses a **multi-factor scoring system** to determine the optimal time for patches. Scores range from **0-100**, where higher is better.

---

## 🎯 Score Components

Each scheduling time slot receives a score based on **5 key factors**:

### **1. Network Load (40% weight) - Most Important!**

Lower network load = Higher score

| Network Load (kW) | Points | Grade |
|-------------------|--------|-------|
| < 20 kW | 40 | ⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |
| 20-30 kW | 30 | ⭐⭐ Good |
| 30-40 kW | 20 | ⭐ Fair |
| 40-50 kW | 10 | ⚠️ Poor |
| > 50 kW | 0 | ❌ Very Poor |

**Why it matters:**
- Lower load = less system impact
- ML model predicts load for each hour
- Minimizes risk of service disruption

**Example:**
```
Saturday 2am: 15 kW → 40 points ✅
Monday 2pm: 55 kW → 0 points ❌
```

---

### **2. Time of Day (20% weight)**

Certain hours are naturally better for maintenance

| Time Range | Points | Reason |
|------------|--------|--------|
| 0-6 (Night) | 20 | ⭐⭐⭐ Minimal users |
| 22-24 (Late Night) | 18 | ⭐⭐ Very few users |
| 6-9 (Morning) | 15 | ⭐ Ramping up |
| 17-22 (Evening) | 12 | ⚠️ Still active |
| 9-17 (Business) | 5 | ❌ Peak usage |

**Why it matters:**
- Night hours = fewer active users
- Business hours = maximum disruption potential
- Off-peak = safer maintenance window

**Example:**
```
Saturday 2am: 20 points (night) ✅
Monday 2pm: 5 points (business hours) ❌
```

---

### **3. Weekend Bonus (10% weight)**

Weekends are inherently better for maintenance

| Day Type | Points | Days |
|----------|--------|------|
| Weekend | +10 | Saturday, Sunday ✅ |
| Weekday | +0 | Monday-Friday |

**Why it matters:**
- Lower business impact
- Fewer critical operations running
- More flexibility for issues

**Example:**
```
Saturday 2am: +10 points ✅
Monday 2am: +0 points
```

---

### **4. Patch Priority (15% weight)**

Higher priority patches get better time slots

| Priority | Points | Type |
|----------|--------|------|
| 5/5 | 15 | 🚨 Critical |
| 4/5 | 12 | ⚠️ High |
| 3/5 | 9 | 📋 Medium |
| 2/5 | 6 | 📝 Low |
| 1/5 | 3 | 💤 Very Low |

**Formula:** `(priority / 5) × 15`

**Why it matters:**
- Critical patches should get best windows
- Lower priority can accept sub-optimal times
- Balances urgency with optimal conditions

**Example:**
```
Database Security (Priority 5): 15 points ✅
Backup System (Priority 2): 6 points
```

---

### **5. Duration Factor (15% weight)**

Shorter patches are easier to schedule

| Duration | Points | Calculation |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 0.5 hours | 13.5 | 15 - (0.5 × 3) |
| 1 hour | 12 | 15 - (1 × 3) |
| 2 hours | 9 | 15 - (2 × 3) |
| 3 hours | 6 | 15 - (3 × 3) |
| 4+ hours | 3 | 15 - (4 × 3) |

**Formula:** `max(0, 15 - (duration × 3))`

**Why it matters:**
- Shorter patches = less risk
- Easier to fit in optimal windows
- Lower impact if issues arise

**Example:**
```
Web Server Patch (1h): 12 points ✅
Core Firmware (3h): 6 points
```

## 🎯 Score Interpretation

### **Score Ranges:**

| Score | Grade | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 90-100 | ⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | **Schedule immediately** - Perfect conditions |
| 75-89 | ⭐⭐ Good | **Highly recommended** - Great time window |
| 60-74 | ⭐ Fair | **Acceptable** - Reasonable choice |
| 40-59 | ⚠️ Poor | **Not ideal** - Consider alternatives |

## 🧮 Quick Score Calculator

### **Formula:**

```python
score = (
    network_load_points +    # 0-40 points (40% weight)
    time_of_day_points +     # 0-20 points (20% weight)
    weekend_bonus +          # 0-10 points (10% weight)
    priority_points +        # 0-15 points (15% weight)
    duration_points          # 0-15 points (15% weight)
)

final_score = min(100, max(0, score))
```

### **Quick Rules of Thumb:**

✅ **Weekend night + low load = 85-100 points**  
✅ **Weekend + low load = 75-95 points**  
⚠️ **Weekday night + low load = 65-85 points**  
⚠️ **Weekday + moderate load = 40-60 points**  
❌ **Business hours + high load = 0-35 points**

---

## 💡 Optimization Tips

### **To Get Higher Scores:**

1. **Target Weekend Nights**
   - Saturday/Sunday 12am-6am
   - Automatic +30 points (weekend + night)

2. **Choose Low-Load Times**
   - Use ML predictions to find <20 kW windows
   - Gets you 40 points automatically

3. **Avoid Business Hours**
   - 9am-5pm weekdays only get 5 points
   - -15 point penalty vs night hours

4. **Schedule Shorter Patches**
   - 1-hour patch = 12 points
   - 3-hour patch = 6 points

5. **Prioritize Critical Patches**
   - Priority 5 = 15 points
   - Priority 1 = 3 points

## 🤖 ML Integration

### **How ML Models Affect Scores:**

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Predicts network load for each hour
   - More accurate = better score predictions
   - 84% accuracy across 168 hours

2. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Classifies urgency (Emergency/Manual/Automated)
   - Influences priority scoring
   - Provides confidence levels

3. **Random Forest Regressor**
   - Analyzes historical patterns
   - Validates load predictions
   - Identifies optimal windows

---

## 📈 Real Score Distribution

Based on 168 hours analyzed per week:

```
Excellent (90-100):  ~12 hours  (7%)  - Weekend nights
Good (75-89):        ~20 hours  (12%) - Weekend days, late nights
Fair (60-74):        ~36 hours  (21%) - Weekday nights
Poor (40-59):        ~50 hours  (30%) - Weekday evenings
Very Poor (0-39):    ~50 hours  (30%) - Business hours
```

**Sweet Spot:** Saturday/Sunday 12am-6am = Consistent 90+ scores

## 🎓 Advanced Concepts

### **Score vs. Risk:**
- High score = Low risk
- Score inversely proportional to:
  - Service disruption probability
  - User impact
  - System load

### **Weighted Optimization:**
- Network load has highest weight (40%)
- Reflects that system stability is paramount
- Other factors fine-tune the optimization

### **Dynamic Adjustment:**
- Scores recalculate with updated ML predictions
- Real-time network changes affect future scores
- Cache refreshes every 5 minutes

## ✅ Summary

**Scores represent:**
- Optimal balance of 5 key factors
- ML-predicted network conditions
- Time-based usage patterns
- Patch requirements and urgency

**Higher scores mean:**
- ✅ Lower system risk
