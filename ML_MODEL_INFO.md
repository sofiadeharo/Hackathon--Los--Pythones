# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Model - Network Load Predictor

## Overview

Your Patch Scheduler now uses a **Random Forest Regression** model to predict network loads and recommend optimal patch windows. **No OpenAI API key needed - works completely offline!**

## How It Works

### 1. **Machine Learning Model**

**Type:** Random Forest Regressor
- **Estimators:** 100 decision trees
- **Training Data:** Weekly network load patterns (168 hours)
- **Features Used:**
  - Day of week (0-6)
  - Hour of day (0-23)
  - Is weekend (binary)
  - Is business hours (binary)

### 2. **What It Predicts**

The model learns patterns like:
- Weekdays have high load (9 AM - 5 PM)
- Nights have low load (2 AM - 6 AM)
- Weekends have lower overall load
- Best patch windows are late night on weekends

### 3. **Training Process**

On server startup:
```
1. Generate 168 hours of network data (7 days Ã— 24 hours)
2. Extract features (day, hour, weekend, business hours)
3. Train Random Forest model
4. Model ready for predictions!
```

## Features

### ðŸ”® **Network Load Predictions**

Ask: "Predict network loads"

The model will forecast loads for different days/times, helping you plan ahead.

### âš¡ **Optimal Window Finder**

Ask: "What's the best time to patch?"

The model evaluates all 168 time windows across the week and ranks them by:
- Predicted network load (lower is better)
- Duration of patch window
- Pattern consistency

### ðŸ“Š **Intelligent Recommendations**

Ask: "Schedule recommendations" or just chat naturally

The model analyzes:
- All pending patches
- Crew availability
- Network load predictions
- Priority levels

Then provides specific recommendations like:
- "Database patch should run Sunday 3 AM (12 kW predicted)"
- "You have sufficient crew capacity"
- "Group similar patches together"

---

## Example Questions

### Predictions
- "Predict network loads for this week"
- "What will the load be on Saturday night?"
- "Forecast Monday morning traffic"

### Optimization
- "What's the best time to patch?"
- "Find optimal windows"
- "When should I schedule the database update?"

### Analysis
- "Analyze crew availability"
- "Do I have enough staff?"
- "Show me patch priorities"

### Model Info
- "How does the model work?"
- "Show me model statistics"
- "What features are most important?"

## Technical Details

### Model Training

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

model = RandomForestRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,  # 100 decision trees
    random_state=42     # Reproducible results
)

# Features: [day_of_week, hour, is_weekend, is_business_hours]
# Target: load_kilowatts

model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Prediction

```python
# Predict load for Saturday 3 AM
features = [5, 3, 1, 0]  # Sat, 3AM, weekend, not business
predicted_load = model.predict([features])[0]
# Result: ~7.5 kW (very low - great for patches!)
```

### Feature Importance

The model learns which features matter most:
- **Hour of day:** ~35-40% (most important!)
- **Is business hours:** ~25-30%
- **Day of week:** ~20-25%
- **Is weekend:** ~10-15%

## Improving the Model

### 1. Add More Historical Data

```python
# In app.py, replace sample data with real historical data
def generate_sample_network_loads():
    # Connect to your monitoring system
    loads = fetch_from_prometheus()  # or Grafana, Nagios, etc.
    return loads
```

### 2. Add More Features

Edit `ml_predictor.py`:

```python
def prepare_features(self, day_of_week, hour):
    # Add more features:
    is_holiday = check_holiday(day_of_week)
    recent_outages = count_recent_outages()
    cpu_usage = get_current_cpu()
    
    return np.array([[
        day_of_week, hour, is_weekend, is_business_hours,
        is_holiday, recent_outages, cpu_usage
    ]])
```

### 3. Try Different Models

```python
# Instead of Random Forest, try:
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
model = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100)

# Or:
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
model = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50))
```

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'max_depth': [10, 20, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    RandomForestRegressor(),
    param_grid,
    cv=5
)
```

## Comparison: ML vs Rule-Based

### Old Way (Rule-Based):
```python
if hour >= 2 and hour <= 6:
    return "Good time to patch"
```
- Simple but inflexible
- Doesn't learn
- Misses patterns

### New Way (ML):
```python
predicted_load = model.predict(features)
if predicted_load < threshold:
    return optimal_windows
```
- Learns patterns
- Adapts to your data
- Considers multiple factors
- More accurate over time

## Troubleshooting

### Model Not Training
**Error:** "Model not trained"

**Fix:** Backend should auto-train on startup. Check console for:
```
ðŸ¤– Initializing ML-powered patch advisor...
âœ… Model trained successfully on 168 data points
```

### Low Accuracy
**Solution:** Add more historical data

```python
# Instead of random sample data
loads = get_last_30_days_from_database()
predictor.train(loads)
```

### Predictions Don't Make Sense
**Check:** Are your features correct?

```python
# Print predictions for debugging
for hour in range(24):
    load = predictor.predict_load(0, hour)  # Monday
    print(f"{hour}:00 - {load} kW")
```
